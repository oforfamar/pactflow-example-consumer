## Prerequisites
* Git. You need to know how to git clone, pull, push and commit.
* Make - it should be installed by default on Linux/Mac. If you have Windows, install it from sourceforge. Note - you won't need any previous experience in using make for this workshop.
* Node 12 or thereabouts.
* Docker.
* A Github account.
* A PactFlow account.

The project uses a Makefile to simulate a very simple build pipeline with two stages - test and deploy.

* Test
  * Run tests (including the pact tests that generate the contract)
  * Publish pacts, associating the consumer version with the name of the current branch
  * Check if we are safe to deploy to prod (ie. has the pact content been successfully verified)
* Deploy (only from master)
  * Deploy app (just pretend for the purposes of this example!)
  * Record the deployment in the Pact Broker

## For the repositiories 

Fork the example-consumer and example-provider projects in to your own Github account (click the 'Fork' button in the top right).
* example-consumer : [https://github.com/pactflow/example-consumer](https://github.com/npawlak/pactflow-example-consumer)
* example-provider : [https://github.com/pactflow/example-provider](https://github.com/npawlak/pactflow-example-provider)

## Step by step

In Github:

1. Open your forked example-consumer project https://github.com/your-username/example-consumer
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Click the button with the text **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**
4. Under the **Workflows** menu on the left, select **Build**.
5. You will see the text **This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger**. To the right of that text is a button with the label **Run workflow**. Click the button.
6. Leave the branch as **maste**r and click the green **Run workflow** button.

*The build will fail with an authentication error when it tries to publish the pact - that's expected. We need to update the configuration to point it at your new PactFlow account.*

## Configure consumer pipeline

The source repositories are configured to use the the public broker at test.pactflow.io. You will need to update the credentials to point to your own PactFlow account. To do this, we need to update the **PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL** environment variable in the Github workflow file, and create a Github Secret to store the PactFlow API token in.

1. Create a Github Secret to store your PactFlow API token in.
* In PactFlow:
     * Log in to your PactFlow account (**https://<your-subdomain>.pactflow.io**), and go to Settings > API Tokens.
     * Click the Copy button for the read/write CI token (make sure it's the read write one, not the read only one).
* In Github:
     * Open your forked **example-consumer** project **https://github.com/your-username/example-consumer**
     * Click on the **Settings** tab.
     * Open the **Secrets and variables** dropdown in the side menu.
     * Select Actions from the dropdown
     * Click the **New repository secret** button
     * Set the name of the secret to **PACTFLOW_TOKEN_FOR_CI_CD_WORKSHOP**
     * Paste in the PactFlow API token value you copied in the previous step.
2. Update your workflow files in GitHub to point at your PactFlow Broker
* In PactFlow:
     * Go to Settings > API Tokens.
     * Click the **COPY PACTFLOW BASE URL** button
* In Github:
     * Open your forked **example-consumer** project **https://github.com/your-username/example-consumer**
     * Open **.github/workflows/build.yml**
     * In the upper right corner of the file view, click üñäÔ∏è to open the file editor.
     * Update the value of **PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL** to the base URL of your own PactFlow account. You can easily get this by clicking the COPY PACTFLOW BASE URL button on the API Tokens page in PactFlow.
     * Press the green **Commit changes** button
3. View the build:
* In Github:
     * Select the most recent build, this will have been triggered when you committed the changes in the last page

*This build should now successfully publish the pact, but it will fail on the can-i-deploy step before it tries to deploy. This is because the provider has not published a successful verification result for the pact.*


## Configure provider pipeline

The source repositories are configured to use the the public broker at test.pactflow.io. You will need to update the credentials to point to your own PactFlow account. To do this, we need to update the **PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL** environment variable in the Github workflow file, and create a Github Secret to store the PactFlow API token in.

1. Create a Github Secret to store your PactFlow API token in.
* In PactFlow:
     * Log in to your PactFlow account (**https://<your-subdomain>.pactflow.io**), and go to Settings > API Tokens.
     * Click the Copy button for the read/write CI token (make sure it's the read write one, not the read only one).
* In Github:
     * Open your forked **example-provider** project **https://github.com/your-username/example-provider**
     * Click on the **Settings** tab.
     * Open the **Secrets and variables** dropdown in the side menu.
     * Select Actions from the dropdown
     * Click the **New repository secret** button
     * Set the name of the secret to **PACTFLOW_TOKEN_FOR_CI_CD_WORKSHOP**
     * Paste in the PactFlow API token value you copied in the previous step.
2. Update your workflow files in GitHub to point at your PactFlow Broker
* In PactFlow:
     * Go to Settings > API Tokens.
     * Click the **COPY PACTFLOW BASE URL** button
* In Github:
     * Open your forked **example-provider** project **https://github.com/your-username/example-provider**
     * Open **.github/workflows/build.yml**
     * In the upper right corner of the file view, click üñäÔ∏è to open the file editor.
     * Update the value of **PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL** to the base URL of your own PactFlow account. You can easily get this by clicking the COPY PACTFLOW BASE URL button on the API Tokens page in PactFlow.
     * Press the green **Commit changes** button
     * Open **.github/workflows/contract_requiring_verification_published.yml**
     * In the upper right corner of the file view, click üñäÔ∏è to open the file editor.
     * Update the value of **PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL** to the base URL of your own PactFlow account. You can easily get this by clicking the COPY PACTFLOW BASE URL button on the API Tokens page in PactFlow.
     * Press the green **Commit changes** button
3. View the build:
* In Github:
     * Select the most recent build, this will have been triggered when you committed the changes in the last page

*After you have pushed your changes to the workflow files, the provider pipeline will run, fetching and verifying the configured pacts from your PactFlow account, and publishing the results back. The can-i-deploy command will pass, and allow the provider to be deployed.*


## Back to the consumer
To make both your builds go green, we are going to retry can-i-deploy, now that the consumer is deployed to production.

1. Find the latest failing **example-consumer** workflow in the Github Actions page (**Actions** -> Under **Workflows**, select **Build** -> **failing build**).
2. In the top right on of the failing job page, select to Re-run the failed jobs (can-i-deploy) (**Actions** -> Under **Re-run jobs**, select **Re-run failed jobs**).
3. The test run should be pre-passing
4. The **can-i-deploy** step should now pass - our consumer is safe to deploy, now that our provider published a verification result, and is deployed to production
5. If you click on the step you should see a successful verification result, and **Computer says yes \o/**
6. The **deploy** step should pass too - our consumer is deployed to production, and we record this with the **record-deployment command**, marking this application version of our consumer as deployed to **production**

*Both consumer and provider builds passing*


## Configure webhook
When using Pact in a CI/CD pipeline, there are two reasons for a pact verification task to take place:

* When the provider changes (to make sure it does not break any existing consumer expectations)
* When a pact changes (to see if the provider is compatible with the new expectations)

To ensure that the verification step is run whenever a pact changes, we need to configure a PactFlow webhook to trigger a provider verification build in Github Actions.

You can see the configuration for this build in .github/workflows/contract_requiring_verification_published.yml in the provider project.<br>

Rather than verifying the pacts with the configured consumer version selectors, it triggers once for each of the following provider versions that are missing a verification result for the newly published pact:
* the latest version from the provider's main branch
* any version currently deployed to an environment

This is achieved by passing the URL of the changed pact to the build via a parameter in the body of the webhook request, as well as the provider version number and the provider branch of the head, test and production versions.

See here for in-depth details about the "contract requiring verification published" event.

The PactFlow webhook will need a Github access token to be able to trigger the build in Github. We don't want the Github token to be stored in clear text in the webhook, so we will create a secret in PactFlow to contain token.<br>

1. Create a Github token.
* In Github:
     * Open the **Personal access tokens page**
     * Click on your profile picture in the top right of the window.
     * Select **Settings** -> Select **Developer settings** from the bottom of the menu on the left -> Select **Personal access tokens** from the menu on the left.
     * Click **Generate new token**
     * Set **Note** to **Token for triggering example-provider pact verification build**
     * Select **public_repo** scope.
     * Select an **Expiration** period for your token
     * Click **Generate token**
     * Copy the value of the token and put it in an open file (or better yet, store it in your password manager!)
     * Create a PactFlow secret for the Github token.

* In your PactFlow account:
     * Go to the Secrets page
     * Click on the Settings icon in the top left (it looks like a cog wheel) -> Select the **Secrets** tab from the menu on the left.
     * Click "ADD SECRET"
     * Select "None" in the team drop down box.
     * Enter the name **githubToken** and paste the value that you copied in the previous step.
     * Click "CREATE"

* Create the "contract requiring verification published" webhook.
     * In your PactFlow account:
     * Select the **Webhooks** tab from the settings page.
     * Click "ADD WEBHOOK".
     * Set:
     * Team: None
     * Description: **Contract requiring verification published webhook for pactflow-example-provider**
     * Consumer: leave as "ALL"
     * Provider: select **pactflow-example-provider**
     * Events: select **Contract published that requires verification**
     * URL:<code>https://api.github.com/repos/your-username/example-provider/dispatches</code>
     * Headers:
     * <code>Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json
Authorization: Bearer ${user.githubToken}</code>

     * Body:
       <code>{
       "event_type": "contract_requiring_verification_published",
       "client_payload": {
        "pact_url": "${pactbroker.pactUrl}",
        "sha": "${pactbroker.providerVersionNumber}",
        "branch": "${pactbroker.providerVersionBranch}",
        "message": "Verify changed pact for ${pactbroker.consumerName} version ${pactbroker.consumerVersionNumber} branch ${pactbroker.consumerVersionBranch} by ${pactbroker.providerVersionNumber} (${pactbroker.providerVersionDescriptions})"
        }
       }</code>
       
     * Click the "TEST" button and ensure that it runs successfully. The Github API returns a 404 instead of an authorization error if the token is not correctly set. If you see a 404, it may be that the URL is incorrect, or it may be that the access token is not configured correctly.

     * Click the "CREATE" button.

2. Verify that the contract_requiring_verification_published verification build for the provider is running correctly

* In Github:
     * Open the Github Actions page for the "contract_requiring_verification_published" workflow
     * Click Actions -> Under Workflows, select contract_requiring_verification_published
     * Select the latest execution
     * This was triggered by pressing the TEST button in our webhook. In our CI/CD workflow, this will be triggered when a real Contract published that requires verification event takes place

üëâ Each of the above steps can be automated in PactFlow via the PactFlow API - you can see the targets for the commands in the provider's Makefile.

Expected state by the end of this step
Both consumer and provider builds passing ‚úÖ
